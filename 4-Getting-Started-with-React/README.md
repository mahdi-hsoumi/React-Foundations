# Using React in Your Project

Chapter 4 introduces how to integrate React into your project by loading React and ReactDOM scripts from an external source. Instead of manipulating the DOM directly with JavaScript, you learn to use ReactDOM.createRoot() and root.render() to render React components within a specified DOM element. This method simplifies UI updates by using JSX, a syntax that resembles HTML but needs to be transformed into JavaScript using Babel.

The chapter highlights the benefits of Reactâ€™s declarative approach, which reduces repetitive code compared to imperative JavaScript methods. React allows you to focus on what you want to display, and it handles the how for you, making UI development more efficient and maintainable.

Additional resources are provided for deeper learning on UI trees, JSX, and essential JavaScript concepts, paving the way for a smoother transition into React development.
