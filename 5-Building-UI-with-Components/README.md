# Building UI with Components

Chapter 5 introduces the core concepts of React, focusing on components as the building blocks of user interfaces. Components in React are self-contained, reusable functions that return UI elements using JSX. By thinking of components like LEGO bricks, you can combine them to create larger structures, making your code more modular and maintainable.

The chapter guides you through creating your first React component, emphasizing the importance of capitalization and proper usage of JSX. It also covers how to nest components within each other to form a component tree, illustrating how complex UIs can be built from simple, reusable parts.

This modular approach allows for easy updates and reuse of components throughout your application, streamlining the development process and reducing redundancy. Additional resources are provided for further exploration of component creation and organization.
