# Displaying Data with Props

In Chapter 6, you learn how to use props to make your React components more dynamic and reusable. Props are custom properties that you can pass to components, similar to how HTML elements use attributes like src or href to modify their behavior. This allows you to create components that can display different content or behave differently based on the data they receive.

The chapter starts by showing how to pass a title prop to the Header component, making it possible to render different headings. You learn to use object destructuring to extract props inside a component and how to embed JavaScript expressions in JSX using curly braces {}.

Next, the chapter introduces you to the concept of iterating over arrays to render lists of data. By using the map() method, you can dynamically generate a list of items in your JSX. The importance of providing a key prop to list items is also covered, which helps React efficiently update and render lists.

This chapter emphasizes the flexibility props provide in React, allowing you to create adaptable components that can handle various data inputs and scenarios.
